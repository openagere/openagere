# agere-shell-escalation

This crate contains the Unix shell-escalation protocol implementation and the
`agere-execve-wrapper` executable.

`agere-execve-wrapper` receives the arguments to an intercepted `execve(2)` call and delegates the
decision to the shell-escalation protocol over a shared file descriptor (specified by the
`AGERE_ESCALATE_SOCKET` environment variable). The server on the other side replies with one of:

- `Run`: `agere-execve-wrapper` should invoke `execve(2)` on itself to run the original command
  within the restricted shell session.
- `Escalate`: forward the file descriptors of the current process so the command can be run
  with broader permissions than the default restricted session. When the process completes, the server forwards the exit code
  back to `agere-execve-wrapper`.
- `Deny`: the server has declared the proposed command to be forbidden, so
  `agere-execve-wrapper` prints an error to `stderr` and exits with `1`.

## Patched zsh

We carry a small patch to `Src/exec.c` (see `patches/zsh-exec-wrapper.patch`) that adds support for `EXEC_WRAPPER`. The patch applies to `77045ef899e53b9598bebc5a41db93a548a40ca6` from https://git.code.sf.net/p/zsh/code. To rebuild manually:

```bash
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/zsh/code
git checkout 77045ef899e53b9598bebc5a41db93a548a40ca6
git apply /path/to/patches/zsh-exec-wrapper.patch
./Util/preconfig
./configure
make -j"$(nproc)"
```
